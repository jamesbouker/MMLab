SmartStep is a multimedia application that helps kindergarten and early elementary students learn and practice basic math skills. Similar to hopscotch or jump rope, this application uses physical activity to reinforce basic math skills (like skip counting); while honing motor skills, pattern recognition, rhythm and coordination. SmartStep uses a standard dance pad for an input device. It has been field tested in local schools through a partnership with the ES BOCES Model Schools program, and it has generated royalties from commercial interests.
