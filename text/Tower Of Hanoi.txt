The Tower of Hanoi project is a computer vision application. In this project we designed a computer-mediated learning task based on the traditional mathematics puzzle, the Towers of Hanoi. Targeted at middle and high school students, the application will help them to learn advanced concepts, like recursion and graph coloring, as they physically try to solve the puzzle in real time, working in groups of two or three.
Our approach involves the use of computer vision to track the location of puzzle pieces on a physical game board. Based on the state of board the application computes the optimal solution, and can provide audio/visual clues to the student, while explaining the principle behind the solution.
The student interface consists of a graphic display of the current state of the puzzle, and a graphic of Sierpinski's Triangle which represents all of the possible moves in the game. As the pieces are moved both the board state and the triangle are updated. Students can look at the triangle to see where in the sequence of moves they are toward solving the puzzle.
