Write On! is an interactive educational program designed for children in grade school. Its purpose is to help students learn how to spell and write simultaneously.
Students are prompted by a pre-recorded voice, and then expected to spell out the word to the best of their ability on a given writing tablet. Any letter that they get correct will appear on the screen, while those that are in incorrect remain hidden with an underscore. The student has the ability to try wrong words until they get it right or skip a word if they find it too difficult. After their game, an administrator has the ability to check a log that records an individual's activity, and see exactly how many times a student chose to either try a word, or skip it entirely.
The game has fifteen pre-made lessons built for kindergarten and first graders. Each lesson focuses on a particular sound or phoneme. In addition, administrators have the ability to create their own customized lessons through the teacher interface in the program.
