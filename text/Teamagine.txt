Teamagine combines speech recognition, handwriting recognition, a semantic knowledge network, and multi-touch capability to provide a public forum for brainstorming, and to support group decision-making. This provides a many-to-many relationship where all the participants are involved. Using infrared light pens for input and a projection device to provide a shared whiteboard, Teamagine creates a fluid environment for group brainstorming activity.
The solution we provide turns any tabletop or blank wall space into a screen for generating, organizing, and exploring ideas. The concepts discussed in a meeting around the table are visualized and can be organized and manipulated in spontaneous natural ways by several participants. Users control the application and add objects to the idea map by speaking, add labels to the map with hand written notes, explore related concepts by tapping them, and group related ideas by dragging their graphical representations. Users can even draw thumbnails of their ideas. Queries can be passed to commercial search engines. A database back-end allows users to save and bookmark brainstorming sessions.
